 Key Design Philosophies:

	Linux assumes you know what you are doing and does anything you tell it to do.

	Make Every Program A Filter Each command will filter the data by making some change to the data for the next command to use.

	Small Is Beautiful And Each Program Does One Thing Well Each command performs a specific task and is very fast because it only does that one thing.

	Choose Portability Over Efficiency And Use Shell Scripts to Increase Leveage And Portability. Portable shell scrips are more efficient beause it can run on even incompatible systems.

What is VPS:
	A virtual machine that is on the internet that acts like an operating system 

Advantages of VPS:
	They cost very little for a small amount of space (ssd) and speed (cpu) and pay more as needed

Bonus (Why is it bad to run programs as a root user?): 

	You are prone to mistakes with the accesability of linux commands. Running on root can destroy everything since it is the master. Also, having malicious software accidentally installed on root gives the software full access to the files.	

Five interesting properties to change once a page is loaded: 

1. Contenteditable -Having this set to true allows content on the page to be 	editable right there on the spot.

2. Onmouseenter
	Does an action to an element when the cursor enters the field of that element. Ex: Makes image bigger when hovering over, then normal when exiting the field.
3. Spellcheck = "true"
	Performs spell check on a text item that is inputted. This can be in an editable part of the page, an empty field to be filled out, etc. Will underline red like in microsoft word for misspelled words.
4. Draggable
	Images and links are draggable (if you drag them, they go with 	your mouse until you let go). You can make text draggable.
5. Hidden
	True/false. Elements can be hidden (not viewable on screen), and then changed (by javascript) when a certain condition is met, like clicking a button or checkbox.
